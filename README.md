FileGrab
=======

FileGrab monitors a Windows filesystem and upload to a FTP server each
file created. It is designed to run on honeypots machines, malaware analystis'
virtual machines and so on in order to capture files created by attackers or
threats.

FileGrab is in alpha stage. Help to make it better by using it and reporting bugs!
